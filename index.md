### Data Science 
[MeLi Challenge [Comming Soon!]](https://ml-challenge.mercadolibre.com/downloads)

Building a Machine Learning Model to predict the next user purchase based on his historic navigation data. Our approach uses Spark for data ingestion, a text classifier and lots of common sense.

### Deep Learning
[Gait Inference Using Pose Estimation](https://github.com/juandados/gait-inference)

A simple methodology for gait prediction based on computer vision that can be used to assist the design process of lower limb active prosthesis. Our proposal uses YOLOv2 for person detection, a human pose estimator build from ResNet-50 and a long-short term memory recurrent network as prediction model.
